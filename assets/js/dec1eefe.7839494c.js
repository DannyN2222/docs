To\nunderstand a particular attribute report line, you have to understand\nhow that SMART attribute is usually handled, keeping in mind who the\nmanufacturer is, and to a lesser extent, what drive model it is. You can\ntry researching it online, but information is really skimpy, nothing\nauthoritative at all from the manufacturers themselves.

I find that once you understand the inconsistencies,\nand keep some perspective, there is much that can still be learned. For\none example, the Seek_Error_Rate (a critical attribute) on Seagate\ndrives generally starts and stays in the mid 50's to high 60's\n(attribute values generally start at 100 and drop to 1). Not knowing\nthis, you might immediately think there is a serious issue with your new\nSeagate drive. But now that you do know this, you won't be concerned\nuntil it drops into the low 50's or below.
